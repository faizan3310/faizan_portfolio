R&D on how to make Chrome to not to show the popup on login - DONE - Kavya       goto    chrome://password-manager/settings   disable  offer to save Passwords

The main reason behind this is when you take input type = "text" and input type = "password" 
major browser shows that pop up. Because browsers have inbuilt functionality 
to show that pop up when you take input type = "password". done through CSS  -webkit-text-security:disc;
#acctPassword{
  -webkit-text-security:disc;
}
or 
do manually
chrome settings-->goto google password manager --> turn off the offer to save the password
