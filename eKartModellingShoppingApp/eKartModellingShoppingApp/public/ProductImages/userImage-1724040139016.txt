HTML Input elements:


    Making container to center of the page
-----------

After user provides/inputs the data
    1. Read the data been given by user 
    2. Send the data to the server
-----------

2 ways 
    1. manually reading data from the input elements (through javascript), make an object of it, and send to the server through AJAX call
    2. Can be done automatically through Form tag 
-----------

Form tag -> A very speical tag, cpable of automatically reading data from all the input elements under it. 
    Form tag takes below two manadate attributes
        i. method -> through which we are going to specify how the communication happens (secured/ non secured)
            method="GET/POST /PUT/Query/Delete etc."
        ii. action-> Through which we specify the path/url of the server, to which data has to be passed

    Eg:

        form method="<type of communication>" action="path or url of the server to which data has to be sent"
    
        <form method="GET" action="http://sample.com/data/userinfo" >
            input elements 
        </form>
